V1
1. User can see cards of kindness.This will be just for the frontend.
    1.1 Each card should have the following:
        1.1.1 Image/Text
        1.1.2 Location/optional(text)
        1.1.3 Caption/optional(text)
        1.1.4 support button
        1.1.5 interested button
        1.1.6 location(place/coordinates)/users location
Create static entries for this.
Then add entries in the database and fetch these entries dynamically.


V2
1. Add location functionality where the location of user will be fetched from their device and 
    they will see the cards from/around that area by default.
2. Database will store each kindness as a document with the above mentioned attributes.We can have multiple/different collections for multiple/different services.
3. Backend routes will return cards based on the location/follower/postId.
